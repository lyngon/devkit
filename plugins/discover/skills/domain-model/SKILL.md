# Domain modeling

Actively build and sharpen the repository's domain model as you design.
This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and decisions down the moment they crystallise.
Merely *reading* `CONCEPTS.md` for vocabulary is not this skill; that is a one-line habit any skill can do.
This skill is for when you are changing the model, not just consuming it.

## File structure

Most repositories have a single context:

```text
/
├── CONCEPTS.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
│       ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│       └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── packages/
```

If the root `CONCEPTS.md` has a `## Contexts` section, the repository has several contexts and the root file is a map pointing to where each one lives:

```text
/
├── CONCEPTS.md                       ← the map
├── docs/
│   └── adr/                          ← repository-wide decisions
└── packages/
    ├── ordering/
    │   ├── CONCEPTS.md
    │   └── docs/adr/                 ← context-specific decisions
    └── billing/
        ├── CONCEPTS.md
        └── docs/adr/
```

Create files lazily: only when you have something to write.
If no `CONCEPTS.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved.
If no `docs/adr/` exists, create it when the first ADR is needed.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONCEPTS.md`, call it out immediately.
"Your glossary defines 'cancellation' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term.
"You're saying 'account': do you mean the Customer or the User? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios.
Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts.

### Cross-reference with code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees.
If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Your code cancels entire Orders, but you just said partial cancellation is possible. Which is right?"

### Update CONCEPTS.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONCEPTS.md` right there.
Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen.
Use the format in [CONCEPTS-FORMAT.md](./CONCEPTS-FORMAT.md), unless the repository has `docs/conventions/concepts.md`, which overrides it.

`CONCEPTS.md` should be totally devoid of implementation details.
Do not treat it as a spec, a scratch pad, or a repository for implementation decisions.
It is a glossary and nothing else.

### Offer ADRs sparingly

Only offer to create an ADR when all three are true:

1. **Hard to reverse**: the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context**: a future reader will wonder "why did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off**: there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If any of the three is missing, skip the ADR.
Use the format in [ADR-FORMAT.md](./ADR-FORMAT.md), unless the repository has `docs/conventions/adr.md`, which overrides it.
